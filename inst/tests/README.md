The file `lds.s` was created to test the specification and disassembly of the group of 8-bit load instructions. After passing this test I created the file `8_bit_load_instructions.h` using the code-generator `csi -q dis.scm 8-bit-load-instructions > tests/8_bit_load_instructions.h` so that anyone can quickly check that changes to the code gen does not break anything it currently does correctly (i.e. these files are for internal reference only). The tmp/ directory was created so that a Makefile could automate this type of test, for that use `make test`.
